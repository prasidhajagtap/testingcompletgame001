# Seamless Dash (Powered by Seamex)

Seamless Dash is a high-performance, mobile-first arcade game developed for the Seamex ecosystem. It serves as an engaging way to showcase the "Seamless" nature of modern HR digital transformation.

## 🚀 Game Concept
You play as **AVA**, flying through a clear morning sky. The goal is to maintain your "Seamless Streak" by dodging "Inefficiency Viruses."

- **The Golden Rule:** Never let go! 
- **Touch & Hold:** Fly and dodge.
- **Lift Finger:** Game Over.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Fluid Animation:** Optimized HTML5 Canvas rendering ensures a smooth 60FPS experience even on mobile browsers (iOS Safari/Android Chrome).
- **Parallax Skies:** Multi-layered background movement creates a realistic high-altitude flying sensation.
- **Power-ups:** Collect the **Seamex Shield** to gain 8 seconds of invincibility.
- **Integrated Trivia:** Learn about the Seamex employee experience and digital HR transformation through random facts on the Game Over screen.
- **Global Leaderboard:** Track your best dashes locally and challenge your colleagues.
- **Social Sharing:** Easily share your high scores with a quirky challenge message via the native mobile share menu.

## 🛠️ Technical Setup
The game is built as a **Single-File Application** for maximum portability and ease of deployment.

### Assets Required:
Ensure the following files are in your root directory:
- `character.png` (92x92 AVA character)
- `icons8-virus-60.png` (Enemy 1)
- `icons8-virus-60 (1).png` (Enemy 2)
- `sheild.png` (Shield power-up)
- `bgm.mp3` (8-bit Morning Theme)
- `Die.mp3` (Game over sound)
- `levelup.mp3` (Level progression sound)
- `powerup.mp3` (Shield activation sound)
- `NEW Seamex logo.png` (Branding)

## 📱 Mobile Optimization
The game uses a **-75px vertical offset** for touch controls. This ergonomic design ensures that the user's thumb never obstructs their view of the character or upcoming obstacles.
