🧠 Seamless Dash – Master Project Summary (Handoff Prompt)
📌 Project Overview

Seamless Dash is a browser-based casual game hosted on GitHub Pages, with a zero-cost backend using Firebase.
The project consists of two separate apps:

Player Game App (seamless-dash)

Secure Admin Panel (seamless-dash-admin)

The goal is to monitor game pulse, player identity, and scores securely, while keeping the game client lightweight and public.

✅ What Is WORKING Now (Current State)
🎮 Game (Player App)

Hosted on GitHub Pages

Fully playable (no gameplay regression)

Login screen collects:

Player Name

Poornata ID (employee ID)

Input validation works correctly on:

Desktop browsers

Mobile browsers

WebView / embedded environments

On first login:

Name + Poornata ID are saved in localStorage

Poornata ID is:

Hashed (SHA-256 + salt) → used as Firestore document ID

Encrypted (AES-GCM) → stored securely for admin decryption

Firebase write is non-blocking (game continues even if Firebase fails)

📤 Data sent to Firebase (players collection):

name

pid_enc → AES-encrypted Poornata ID

pid_iv → AES IV

pid_fp → short fingerprint for sanity/debug

highScore (currently static / initial)

createdAt

lastSeen

banned (default false)

🔐 Security Model (Important)

Poornata ID is NEVER stored in plain text

Game client:

Uses encryption + hashing

Has no read access to Firebase

Firebase rules:

Allow unauthenticated writes (required for GitHub Pages)

Disallow all public reads

Admin reads require Firebase Auth

🧑‍💼 Admin Panel (seamless-dash-admin)

Hosted on GitHub Pages

Separate repo from the game

Uses Firebase Auth (email/password) for admin login

Requires manual AES key entry (same key as game) to decrypt IDs

After login + key:

Loads all players from Firestore

Decrypts Poornata IDs client-side

Displays data in a responsive table

📊 Admin Panel Features Working

Secure login

AES key gate

View:

Player Name

Actual Poornata ID (decrypted)

High Score (current value)

Last Seen timestamp

Banned status

Actions:

Ban / Unban player

Export CSV

Export Excel

UI:

Fully responsive (mobile + desktop)

Styled to match game branding

Auto refresh (configurable) + manual refresh button

❌ What Is NOT Yet Integrated (Explicitly Pending)
🎯 Gameplay → Backend Integration (Pending)

Live gameplay metrics are NOT yet wired

Currently missing:

Real-time score updates

Session tracking

Level progression stats

Shield usage

Rage quits

Device / geo / analytics metrics

👉 Right now, Firebase only knows:

Who logged in

What their encrypted Poornata ID is

A placeholder / initial high score

🧩 Architectural Decisions (Why Things Are Done This Way)

GitHub Pages → requires unauthenticated writes

Firestore → cheap, scalable, zero-cost at low usage

AES encryption (not hashing) → future-proof for:

ADFS handshake

Corporate SSO integration

Separate Admin App → prevents exposure of decryption logic

Client-side encryption → no backend server required

🔑 Key Material (Critical)

AES key:

Hardcoded (obfuscated) in game client

Manually entered in admin panel

Same key required for decryption

No AES key stored in Firebase

🚀 Next Logical Steps (Future Work)

These are intentionally not done yet:

Push gameplay events to Firestore (sessions collection)

Update high score after each game

Add analytics aggregation for:

DAU

Session length

Level distribution

Rage quits

Admin charts / dashboards

Optional:

Key rotation

ADFS / SSO bridge

Cloud Functions (if backend allowed later)

🧾 One-Line Status Summary

“Seamless Dash currently has secure identity capture and admin visibility fully working, with encrypted Poornata ID flow end-to-end. Gameplay analytics and score syncing are the next integration phase.”
